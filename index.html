        <h1> Interest in IT</h1>
        <ul>
            
            <li class="bold">What is your interest in IT?</li>
            <p>I interested in IT because IT has been affecting every aspect of our lives positively. It can make things easier to do, and in some cases, people do not even have to do it manually. The machines will do it automatically within a short amount of time. Besides, I also really into making apps that can benefit people to make life so much more comfortable in the long run. The event sparked my interest in IT was when I had an opportunity to see my brother playing video games on his laptop. I was fascinated by all the animations and colorful things that showed up just on a little screen. That is the moment that fired me to explore more about anything associated with Information Technology.</p>

            <li class="bold"> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
            <p>I choose to study at RMIT mostly because RMIT University has the top-notch facilities, and I also have a chance to study the equivalence degree of Melbourne’s program. Besides, the high percentage of being employed after graduation is also one of the main reasons.</p>

            <li class="bold">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
            <p>I expect to learn the foundation about every facet of the IT industry, from basic concepts to soft-skills in the first semester. Therefore, when moving to the next semesters, I can figure out what aspect of the IT industry I think is interesting and can decide to learn in-depth about one (or two) specific area(s) to have a successful career in the IT industry after graduation.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">The results of an online <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs test</a>:</span> Advocate - INFJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging) - Quiet and mystical, yet very inspiring and tireless idealists.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Strengths:</span> Creative, Insightful, Inspiring - Convincing, Decisive, Determined - Passionate, Alustric.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Weakness:</span> Sensitive, Extremely Private, Perfectionistic, Can Burn Out Easily. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Meaning of the test:</span> From this test result, I understand that I am the person that believes in my inner vision and my values, which means that I will fight tirelessly for my beliefs. And those are the factors that guide me to make every decision in my daily life. Although having an inborn sense of idealism and morality, I am not an idle dreamer. I can visualize what goals I want to achieve and make a detailed plan to accomplish it. However, my goals are not usually something that only benefits myself, but they also bring benefits to other people. I want to create something with my color that can solve issues people can face in life. On the other hand, I often want everything I do is perfect, which means that I can not easily satisfy with a result and often do more to level up my products and myself. That can be a good trait in some cases, but it can often get me stressed and easily burned out. Therefore, I think I have to learn to be satisfied with what I can achieve in the present, positively believe in myself, and strive tirelessly for my beliefs. Furthermore, I am also very sensitive, with just one word that can hurt me, and sometimes I need to be alone to get things done. Therefore, privacy is a must for me when I have to deal with difficult situations.</li>

                    <li>As a Tactile learner, the best way for me to learn something is by physical movement/doing. I can remember and understand things better when I actively engage in physical activities like practicing, not just reading notes but more like creating something by applying what I’ve learned. For me, sitting still for a long period can easily get me bored; therefore, I should take short, frequent breaks during self-study periods to recharge my battery and can be in the best version of me to learn and have better understand about new things.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Openness</span> describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways, and it is strongly related to a person’s interest in art and culture. 83% of the result at the chart above is a sign that shows that I tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. I like discovering novel experiences, playing with ideas, and enjoying art. Therefore, when facing an issue, I tend to think about all possible solutions, not just finding something so solve it but trying every possibility so that I can experience more. I also like trying to create new ways to approach the problems rather than follow what has done before.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Conscientiousness</span> describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control to pursue their goals. 69% of the result means that I can keep myself on track to achieve long-term achievements. I can often (not always) win over my feelings and do not depend too much on my mood to do something. I know that I have to do it to get what I want.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Extraversion</span> describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. It is also related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. 73% means that I really enjoy being around with many people, and I often surround me with great and talented people so that I can learn many valuable things from them. And I always seek compliments for what I have done. That is a kind of motivation to push me forward and continue to do great things. Moreover, I am thrilled by victories; therefore, I always try my best to get what I want to have that great satisfying feeling.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Agreeableness</span> describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own and to cooperate rather than compete with others. 71% means that I tend to have a great deal of empathy and pleasure from serving and taking care of others. Additionally, I want to make my positive impacts long-lasting to as many people as possible, and I want to help them elevate themselves and have a wonderful life. That is one of my main motivations when choosing to study Information Technology. I believe that technology can help people to have better lives.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Neuroticism</span> describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. 44% means that I am not usually experiencing these negative emotions. When facing problems, I could feel fear and anxiety, but most of the time, I can remove it from my brain and focus on what I can do the best to get the outcomes that I want.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><p class="bold">How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</p> 
                <p>I think when working as a team, I will be a person that connects people as a real team, and I also be the one that encourages everyone to work to find out the most feasible solution to deal with the issues that we will face. I can also be a good role model to show good self-disciplined and work hard to achieve my goals. Therefore, I can inspire my teammates and make them become the best version of themselves. Moreover, I can be the one that they can talk to whenever they have any problems, not only about technical things but also about mental issues. Working as a team to me is not to do some assignments together to get a high mark, what I truly care is that what I can do to help them to become the better version of themselves and as a result, every member in my team can do their best, and we can together achieve our goals. I believe that the great team that is not all about having the most talented people, but it is about how well every member of a team collaborates. Every team member is a role model to help other teammates get out of their comfort zone and elevate themselves. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
                <p>I want to find the person that has the same vision with me to form a team. Introvert or Extrovert or any personality is not an important thing. The most important is that they are more than willing to do everything to achieve our goals and share their issues or opinions so that a team can have more different views and choose the best one to tackle a problem.</p>

<!--Project Idea-->
    
    <div  class="project">
        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Overview:</span> I want to build a web app related to the cooking field. I name it “EasyCook”. EasyCook can suggest what you can do with your leftovers or the remaining ingredients when you finish cooking. It can also show you tons of recipes so that you can try to make the new dish, or you can check whether it is safe to combine some ingredients or eat some meals with something else without facing any problems.

            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Motivation:</span> There are <a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/consumption/foods-and-beverages/food-waste-facts" target="_blank">1.3 billion</a>  tons of fresh, delicious food/ingredients wasted every year, which costs <a href="https://olioex.com/food-waste/food-waste-facts/" target="_blank">$1 trillion annually</a>. And there is an interesting fact that in most developed countries, over half of the food waste occurs in the home. Meanwhile, nearly 1 billion people that is hungry around the world, and this problem can easily solve just only by less than a quarter of the food that we throw away every year. Another fact is that reducing food waste can <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/1/150122-food-waste-climate-change-hunger/" target="_blank">alleviate environmental issues</a>  such as climate change. Therefore, this app will not only help users to have more economical and healthy meals, but also ease the problem of wasting food that the world is facing.</li>
            <li><span class='bold'>Description:</span> There are four main features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Search for the recipe to cook with the remaining ingredients or leftovers: There will be boxes that appear when people use the app. They can tick into boxes of the name of the ingredient or add manually by typing the ingredient name that they have. After that, the list of recipes you can cook with those ingredients will appear, and there are also detailed instructions for the users to cook that dish. </li>
                    <li>Search to check is it safe to combine/eat anything together, and I name it “Check Poison”: There will be boxes for users to tick like the first feature, but unlike the first one, this is the feature to check that it is safe to combine something when you try to explore more about cooking. For example, people should not eat durian and drink alcohol at the same time because it will lead to some chemical reactions inside their body, and they will eventually suffer from symptoms such as headache, vomiting, heart palpitations, nausea, facial flushing, and low blood pressure. In the worst scenario, this phenomenon can be fatal</li>
                    <li>Read news or articles to have more knowledge about health concerns or a suggested diet menu: It will have some articles/news about foods and health concerns so that users can explore more about healthy lifestyles and eat healthily at the same time. Also, they can examine thousands of styles of diet menus that fit them and try to follow one of those to have a more healthy and active life.</li>
                    <li>There will be a forum serve as a personal blog where users can share their recipes or diet programs to everyone to try and have a novel experience. Nevertheless, before updating the recipe, it has to be verified by the professional team of the app to ensure there are nothing wrongs for everyone to follow those. Besides, people can also review or post their comments to have a variety of aspects of those recipes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Tools and Technologies</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sketch and layout the design: Pencil, pen, and paper</li>
                    <li>Front-end (Client-side): represent the website content and allow users to interact with those content. The most common front-end languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, front-end framework can make the process of building how the website looks more efficient such as Bootstrap for HTML and CSS, and Angular for JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>Back-end (Server-side): manage data, create the logic of a website. There are three parts in Back-end, including programming languages (follow with their frameworks), database, and server. The most common programming languages are PHP (Laravel) and Ruby (Ruby on Rails). In term of database, we have MySQL and PostgreSQL. Finally, we have to host a server, using service from Apache or Nginx.</li>
                    <li>Devices to code: PCs or Laptops</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Skills required</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build and develop Front-end and Back-end: Coding, Debugging, Optimizing and Testing</li>
                    <li>Collaboration with other people to build the project</li>
                    <li>Design the layout and plan the workflow of the website</li>
                    <li>Marketing knowledge: to advertise the website to have more users</li>
                    
                </ul>
            <p>These skills can be found and learn through some research on the Internet and academic books. Nevertheless, it will consume a very large amount of time to learn and master all these skills.</p>
            
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Outcomes:</span> If the project is successful, the food waste problem and hunger can be alleviated. People can simultaneously know how to enjoy delicious meals using the leftovers or remaining ingredients and not worry about having food poisoning problems. So, not only the normal people will be benefited from this web app, but also the underprivileged people can also gain some benefits.</li>
