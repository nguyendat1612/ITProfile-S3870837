            <li>What is your interest in IT?</li>
            <p>I interested in IT because IT has been affecting every aspect of our lives positively. It can make things easier to do, and in some cases, people do not even have to do it manually. The machines will do it automatically within a short amount of time. Besides, I also really into making apps that can benefit people to make life so much more comfortable in the long run. The event sparked my interest in IT was when I had an opportunity to see my brother playing video games on his laptop. I was fascinated by all the animations and colorful things that showed up just on a little screen. That is the moment that fired me to explore more about anything associated with Information Technology.</p>

            <li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
            <p>I choose to study at RMIT mostly because RMIT University has the top-notch facilities, and I also have a chance to study the equivalence degree of Melbourneâ€™s program. Besides, the high percentage of being employed after graduation is also one of the main reasons.</p>

            <li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
            <p>I expect to learn the foundation about every facet of the IT industry, from basic concepts to soft-skills in the first semester. Therefore, when moving to the next semesters, I can figure out what aspect of the IT industry I think is interesting and can decide to learn in-depth about one (or two) specific area(s) to have a successful career in the IT industry after graduation.</p>
